Oh my god, I forgot how to GIT. My github username was set to something utterly random. I had to change my configs first.

It took me about thirty mintues to set the whole thing up. WTH... I created the repo in github, next I had to create a branch locally on my Mac and I thought it should be done with $> git remote add. But NOOOOO, some configs changed, I had to set it to simple. That's on me, for not following what's happening in the non-Google world. Next thing is that I am not given access to push to my own repo!

This is heavily embarassing. It took me a whole thirty minutes to do a simple git push :( Well, it's working now, and after setting the upstream (finally) it worked for me.

Root of the problem: My fucking keychain was supplying creds when it shouldn't have. :/ Thankfully, someone in the internet experienced and was grateful for exposing this in Stack Overflow. At this point, I'd have given up, thank god for Eminem in the background.

git lfs

Huh, didn;t know git had a new functionality to store large files!

du -h Who knew about that little fella

brew update needed before getting git lfs to work

SPent an hour or so to get git's lfs to work :( I still have no idea what I did wrong.

Screw this, .gitignore to the rescue.

What the fuck is happening?

There is always this one thought in the back of my head. "What the fuck is my purpose?". One of my close friends, who just recently got married (May he lead a very Happy Life), declared one day that there is none. Everyone has a purpose in their life. It's something that I firmly believe in and I have no idea why? Thinking a little deeper. Yeah, Why should my life has a purpose.

I usually find answers to these question in a green environment (if you know what I mean). Another friend of mine asked me if every organism has a purpose, what is the purpose of a child who was mis-delivered. Kind of a dark question, I know. May be the reason for our existence is to search the reason for our existence.



Like every problem in the world, the very first step is to know that there is a problem. And my problem is that I'm a guy in my mid-20s who has no idea what to do next in his life. My facebook feed recently is full of my friends getting engaged, married. And this kinda confuses me a litte to a point where I've started to ask myself, "Should I be getting married as well?".

To the people who cannot identify India in a World Map, I come from a culture where there exists this amazing thing called Arranged Marriages. Yep, marriages are arranged, just like how you'd arrange a ten-year old kid's birthday party.

The process is really simple. You place a call to your parents and tell them that you want to get married. Only problem is, my mom would think that this is a joke.

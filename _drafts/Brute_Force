Still lines kinda add thickness to it.... Hmmm... Okay brute force this shit. Ain't nobody got time for that. Pro tip: Crosswords are symmetrical :|

Here's what I'm gonna do. Get the lowest X,Y coordinate and get the highest X,Y. Go from the smallest X0 that you can find and make sure that there is a line at each increasing increment.

Doesn't work as they numbers aren't exact... I do have the number of intersections though....

Implemented a thickness filter.

Start a set with one line. Add a line iff there are no lines that are closer to any line in the existing set.

Got the entire grid.... Now onward to using Tesseract!!!

Identify boudnary conditions. Lowest point should be such that, x+y should be the smallest. Similar for x+y.
